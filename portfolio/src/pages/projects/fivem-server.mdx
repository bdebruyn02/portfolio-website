# FiveM Server

As the lead developer, I ran a successful FiveM Server in South Africa, drawing in a lively community of hundreds of players. The project taught me invaluable lessons in hosting and configuration servers. Along the way, I sharpened my skills in MySQL and Lua scripting, troubleshooting server performance issues, and debugging game code.
