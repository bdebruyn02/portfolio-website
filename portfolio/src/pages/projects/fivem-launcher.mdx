# FiveM Launcher

Built with Angular and Electron, the launcher lets you connect to any FiveM server without opening the FiveM program separately. I noticed people paying for a similar tool unnecessarily and created a free alternative. This project marked my first time combining Angular and Electron, with Electron enabling access to the native system shell for connecting to user-saved servers.
